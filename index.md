for fast and efficient implementation of Internet-driven Process Control Applications, all the way from the Factory
Floor to Enterprise level. By the choice of the Internet standards and the Java Technology, Bali Automation is able to
leverage these technologies and scale into virtually any complexity and performance.

== The Future is here ==
It is no longer necessary to wait for the most obvious network solution for Process Control, Building Automation and
many other control, supervision, monitoring and automation tasks.

    It is called Internet.

    - Do you believe that Internet is the future of all communication solutions?
    - Do you believe that the Human-Machine-Interface should be any standard web browser from any computer on Internet?
    - Do you believe that Alarm conditions should be distributed by Email and/or SNMP messages, just like other
      notifications from the system to any number of destinations, anywhere in the world, directly from the source?

If you answer YES, on any of these questions, you WILL find our path to full customer satisfaction very appealing and
cost effective.

When the competition is talking about future solutions to customer's information needs, Bali Automation delivers. While
the competition is twisting and tweaking old technologies, so that it can be labeled Internet, Bali Automation has
developed a completely new concept and approach to Process Control, completely built from the ground up on top of the
most robust, reliable and proven infrastructure available - the Internet..
